        "For more info about `gpt-2-simple`, you can visit [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple). You can also read Max's [blog post](https://minimaxir.com/2019/09/howto-gpt2/) for more information how to fine-tune GPT-2 for yourself on whatever data you want (maybe so, maybe not).\n",

But this version creates much more realistic output since the GPT-2 model is very powerful, whereas Imaginary Phish uses a very simple character-RNN model. The downside is that this version can't run directly in Javascript, hence this fancy notebook.\n",

        "1. You need to be logged into a Google account to run Colab notebooks like this one. You will get a warning when you try to run the notebook as I've shared globally and isn't authored by Google. You can click \"Run Anyways\" as this notebook is harmless (I promise. You can look at all the code by expanding the cells to see what it runs).\n",
        "2. Run the cells below. You can select \"Run all\" from the runtime menu, or select each cell and click the run icon on the left side of that cell, or use the keyboard command control-Enter.\n",
        "3. Make any changes you want to the controls in the last cell and re-run that cell.\n",
        "  - Adjust the temperature slider to make the results crazier or more predictable. Higher temperature = stranger results.\n",
        "  - Write your own prompt to start the generation, or leave it blank. For example, use something like \"After the song, Trey asked the audience\" to get the model to generate some imaginary show notes, or \"Tweezer -> 46 Days ->\" to see what it wants to play next.\n",
        "  - Adjust the length to determine how much text to create at a time.\n"
